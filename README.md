# DSA_HashMap_IntervalHeap_Assignment
1. A function Insert(int d) in class IntervalHeap that inserts data element d in the interval heap. 

  An interval heap is a binary heap in which each node contains two elements (except the last node). It is a complete binary tree in which:
The left element is less than or equal to the right element.
Both the elements define a closed interval.
Interval represented by any node except the root is a sub-interval of the parent node.
Elements on the left hand side define a min heap.
Elements on the right hand side define a max heap.

2. Similarly give the implementation of update, delete and display member functions for the interval heap class.
